## be more social on netflix, with comments

thanks to [eshan276](https://github.com/Eshan276/netflix_comment_extension) for the disqus backend work\
thanks to [sincere tuitt](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/netflix-comment-section/mfkjapioajagkobocefmedkjgedkbegc) for this extension (the backend server is now dead)

finally massive thanks to [sammcj](https://github.com/sammcj/firefox-local-addon-manager) for the hack to auto load unsigned extensions into stable firefox (you might need to use this)

## by combining these i was able to make one working extension to add comments to netflix

for a screenshot, view my greasyfork link of [this](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/543455-newmetro-ui-for-netflix) netflix theme that mentions it

to theme this extension's elements like i demo in the screenshots, because it's in an iframe, you'll need the ublock origin filter list mentioned [here](https://github.com/sawyerthemiller/the-clean-web)\
to use this or ublock on chrome, you must ['jailbreak'](https://www.neowin.net/guides/you-can-still-enable-ublock-origin-in-chrome-here-is-how/) chrome if on windows

if you are on mac, use my 'chrome vanced' app found in the releases of my 'the clean web' repo. it's an automator app, so open it with apple automator to view source code

then get [ublock origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) and if you want to use this extension, get [foxified](https://foxified.org/) to use it, please know this is unsupported currently by me

> [!warning]
> this extension, all my other web theming ones, and my adblock filter list will always stay free... but
>
> i have received a few hurtful comments directed to me before in my reddit pms about charging for my netflix theming script ($2), but please be considerate
>
> i write a lot of code to improve the web and other things. i spend time curating an adblock filter with over 1500 lines, and if you really want, the paywall in the theme can be easily bypassed
>
> in reality, you could even ask ai to write your own version and say you're the developer removing the paywall. the downside is updates i push break it
>
> netflix heavily randomizes their class names, so i must update this pretty frequently. i also pay for the cors proxy that allows users to register and support this work
